# Finks - Lightweight Self-Hosting Platform-as-a-Service Agent

> **Finks** - From German "Fink" (finch): a small, agile songbird known for adaptability and efficient foraging

A CLI self-hosting Platform-as-a-Service tool that enables developers to deploy and manage applications on their own servers with minimal overhead.

## What it will do

- **Application Deployment** - Deploy applications using Docker containers with simple CLI commands
- **Process Management** - Start, stop, restart, and scale applications effortlessly
- **System Monitoring** - Real-time CPU, RAM, disk, and network metrics display
- **Log Management** - Stream and view application logs in real-time
- **Health Monitoring** - Comprehensive system and application health checks
- **Local Management** - Everything runs locally on your server, no external dependencies

## Philosophy

**Control Your Infrastructure**: Own your deployment pipeline without vendor lock-in or external services.

**Lightweight by Design**: Finks is small and efficient - minimal resource usage allows hosting multiple applications even on small VPS instances.

**CLI-First**: Professional command-line interface for fast, scriptable operations that integrate seamlessly with existing workflows.

**Fast & Beautiful**: Quick deployment times and elegant, intuitive user experience.

## Use Cases

- **Indie Developers**: Deploy side projects on cheap VPS instances
- **Small Teams**: Self-host applications without expensive PaaS fees
